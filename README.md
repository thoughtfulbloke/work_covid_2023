# work_covid_2023
This is where all the files and analysis code for David Hood's presentation to the Covid &amp; Work Symposium on the 23rd of February 2023 https://events.otago.ac.nz/covidandwork/ are going to be made available in the hope they are useful to others.
As I am still working with the data, so at time of writing this my presentation is not yet finished, this repo will not have all the contents in it until close to the presentation date.
